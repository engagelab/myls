    <h1>Project title: Learning with the internet. A mixed-methods study to explore undergraduate students’ learning with non-curricular resources and digital tools</h1>
    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in the project, ‘Exploring undergraduate students’ learning with non-curricular resources and digital tools’!</p>
    <h2>Purpose of the project</h2>
    <p>This project’s aim is to understand how specialized resources available on the Internet become part of the learning process of undergraduate students in computer and software engineering programs. Three research questions will be asked about: a) Which domain-specific activities and resources involving the Internet are common among the students during their studies? b) How do students differ in time when using these resources on the Internet for learning purposes? c) How does the use of these resources influences learning activities and tasks that are part of the regular curriculum?</p>
    <h2>Who is responsible for the research project?</h2>
    <p>University of Oslo, Department of Education is the institution responsible for the project.</p>
    <h2>Why are you being asked to participate?</h2>
    <p>The study includes students who are part of computer and software engineering programs, and your course has being chosen as case for investigating the use of online resources that relate to the domain of your studies.</p>
    <h2>What does participation involve for you?</h2>
    <p>If you chose to take part in the project, this will involve installing a Google Browser Extension in your personal computer, in which you will answer a survey that will last maximum 30 minutes, and taking part in an interview. The survey will involve answering questions about learning to program and other software development related activities, the websites you use to carry them out, and granting access to the browsing history only of those specific websites you report to use during the survey. The interview will last maximum 60 minutes including questions about the goals of carrying out these activities on the Internet and their value for learning, the challenges carrying out these activities suppose for you, and their relation with your studies. The interview will be audio recorded. All your answers will be anonymized after the data collection process is completed.</p>
    <h2>How long will the collection of information from the survey and the websites you report you use will take?</h2>
    <p>You are given a period of 3 weeks from the moment you are invited to participate in the study to install the Google Chrome Extension and answer the survey.</p>
    <h2>Do you have to be logged at all times during the data collection period?</h2>
    <p>No, it is only necessary for the extension to be installed during the time you will answer the survey. You are allowed to opt-out at any moment before submitting the survey. You can uninstall the Google Chrome Extension once you have submitted the survey.</p>
    <h2>When is the information from the survey and the websites you report you use registered?</h2>
    <p>The data collection of both survey responses and browsing history data will take place only in the moment the survey is submitted in the Google Chrome Extension. There will be no data collection outside of this timeframe. This means that even if the Google Chrome Extension is installed beforehand, it will only collect data the moment you submit the survey.</p>
    <h2>What happens if you uninstall the Google Chrome Extension?</h2>
    <p>If you uninstall the Google Chrome Extension without submitting the survey, no data will be collected. If you uninstall the Extension after the survey is submitted, the collected data will remain stored only and securely on a UiO local server.</p>
    <h2>How is the information from the survey and websites you report you use received by us?</h2>
    <p>The Extension will collect data using the chrome.history API and filtering only the websites you report to use during the survey. The information will be processed and stored only and directly on a a secure UiO local server.</p>
    <h2>What information is registered from the websites you report you use?</h2>
    <p>Once you had submitted your answers to the survey in the Google Chrome Extension reporting the websites you use for learning to program and other software development related activities, the Extension will register information from your web browsing history of the last 90 days from the moment you submit the survey, only of those websites you report you use. The information collected for each website corresponds to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total number of visits.</li>
      <li>The date and time of each visit.</li>
      <li>The URL address of each visit</li>
      <li>The way the user accessed the particular website each visit (clicking a link on another page, typing the URL, clicking a bookmarked link, among other alternatives).</li>
      <li>The title of the website.</li>
    </ul>
