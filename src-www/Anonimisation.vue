    <h1 class="m-2">Data Anonymization and Browser History Data</h1>
    <p class="m-4">The moment you submit the survey, all your answers and the data from your browser history will be stored and analyzed using an encrypted ID code.
      I will only access your personal email once the analysis of that data is over, in order to invite you to participate in a group interview on Zoom.
      The results of this analysis wonâ€™t reveal any specific individual response.
      In the image you can see an example of how the browser history data collected and the encrypted coding looks like.
